# Decentralized Lottery System

This repository contains a decentralized lottery system implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The system allows users to enter the lottery by sending a minimum amount of Ether, and a winner is randomly selected to receive the total pool of Ether collected.

The project consists of two main components:
1. **Smart Contract**: The smart contract is written in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for Ethereum smart contracts. It handles the logic of the lottery system, including participant entry, random number generation, and winner selection.
2. **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the smart contract, allowing users to enter the lottery and view the list of participants.


## How to Use

1. Open the decentralized lottery system in your browser.
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the network.
3. Enter the amount of Ether you wish to contribute to the lottery (must be greater than 0.01 Ether).
4. Click the "Enter Lottery" button.
5. Wait for the lottery period to end.
6. Click the "Pick Winner" button to randomly select a winner.
7. The winning amount will be transferred to the winner's Ethereum address.
8. Repeat the process for subsequent lotteries.
